## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. User selects investor → `toggleInvestorSelection()` called
2. Investor ID added to `selectedInvestors` Set
3. `updateUI()` called
4. `displaySelectedInvestorsList()` iterates through `selectedInvestors`
5. Matches data from `allInvestorsData` array
6. Creates and displays cards dynamically
7. Attaches event listeners to remove buttons

### State Management
- `selectedInvestors` Set: Maintains list of selected investor IDs across all pages
- `allInvestorsData` array: Stores current page investor data with full details
- Updates synchronized across:
